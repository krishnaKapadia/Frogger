/** The snake is created at a random position with a random direction.
 * The constructor does not have any parameters.
 * It can move
 *  - makes it go forward one step in its current direction.
 *  - if outside arena boundaries, makes it go backward one step, and then turn to a new (random)
 *         direction.
 *  The walls of the arena are determined by the constants:
 *    FrogSnakeGame.TopWall, FrogSnakeGame.BotWall, FrogSnakeGame.LeftWall and FrogSnakeGame.RightWall
 * It can report its current position (x and y) with the
 *  getX() and getY() methods.
 *  draw() will make it draw itself,
 *  erase() will make it erase itself
